# Open Fortress Zombies Standalone Build

Open Fortress Zombies is a mod inspired by the call of duty zombies gamemode, bringing most of the features such as the very enjoyable wave survival system, perk machines, wall weapons, etc.

This base sourcemod comes with 5 maps, 5 perk machines, custom sounds, 7 new custom weapons, and a whole weapon rebalance centered around the sourcemod.

# ==How to download==
Extract the open-fortress-zombies-standalone-main.zip into your sourcemods folder and rename it to, open_fortress_zombies then restart steam.

# ==Launching maps==
For right now the create server menu does not work and will crash your game, you need to push the ` key to pull up the dev console and type in "map dm_nz_" for all of the available OFZ maps, select or type in the map name you wish to load and hit enter.

# ==Other stuff==
This is the base game, if you would like to start creating levels watch my video tutorial here: https://youtu.be/s91Odub5aOo
