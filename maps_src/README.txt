If you want to learn how to make Open Fortress Zombies maps you came to the
right folder, the template map is a simple map with everything to get started,
the prefab map is for copying and pasting into your levels, or if you want a
clean start.

Just a note before you get started, make sure you make a custom folder for
your addon in the Open Fortress Custom folder so your Open Fortress Zombies
doesn't get messy.

If you need help on anything come ask me questions
